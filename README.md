# refmgr-web
Web project for a referral manager leveraging Microservices and Spring Cloud

## Building and Running the Project

I built this using the demo from Angular2's website: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html

To open the app in a browser, I used npm start from the command line. This ran a script defined in the package.json file.
